        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
        the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
        others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily
        “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

        Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major
        spoilers, and it is recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

        <p >This one’s another one for the completist horror fan. It’s not a bad film by any means. It’s actually pretty
          great, and quite terrifying. It’s just… very bleak, with nothing much to wash it down with. Director Pascal
          Laugier has gotten a lot of guff for this film over the years, including from the two lead actresses. He even
          went so far as to open the DVD presentation of Martyrs with an apology to its viewers. Laugier wants you to
          know that he’s sorry for what he has committed to film. He shouldn’t be sorry. He created what’s become an
          important film in the New French Extremity movement, and those are some great films to be associated with.
